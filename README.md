General Assembly SEI Project 2: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Imperium
___
## Welcome

This project is a website that allows players of the RPG Traveller to peruse a map of space, search for worlds, and read more about various aspects of the Traveller universe.

## About

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Imperium was built using Javascript, React, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.  It uses API calls to present an interactive map of the Known Universe that players of the game can zoom in and out on, as well as scroll around.  There is also a Library menu that presents the user with an array of topics pertaining to things they may encounter on the map.  Clicking on each topic will open a modal with more information.  Finally, there is a search function, where players can type in the name of a planet, or a characteristic of a planet they are looking for (for instance, "Industrial," "Scout Base," etc.)
