            The name given to a race of intelligent, non-human beings who
            inhabited various locations in this portion of the galaxy
            approximately -300,000. Archeological evidence recovered from
            excavations of the few known Ancient cities indicates that the race
            destroyed itself during a 2,000 year period of intense warfare which
            left only ruined cities and shattered planets.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The Ancients were responsible for several major features within the
            region now occupied by the Imperium. Their warfare resulted in the
            large proportion of asteroid belts throughout this spiral arm. There
            is evidence that they created the multi-world rosette at Tireen (in
            the Vargr Extents). Scattered empty cities (most severely damaged by
            battle) stand as evidence of their wars; most, however, are
            restricted areas under investigation by the Imperium and not open to
            the public.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The Ancients are generally accepted as responsible for the
            dissemination of Humaniti within its current domain when they
            transplanted genetic stock from Terra to at least forty worlds
            across a span of some 360 parsecs.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The Ancients were also responsible for the creation of the Vargr
            through genetic manipulation of carnivore/chaser stock. Apparently,
            they used Terran canine stock acquired at the same time as humaniti.

            The Aslan are a race of intelligent beings with an established
            interstellar empire spinward and rimward of the Imperium; in
            addition, large numbers have settled within the Imperium. Aslan
            stand roughly human-sized, averaging 2.0 meters in height and
            weighing about 100 kg. They are descended from four-limbed, upright,
            bipedal carnivore/pouncer stock, originally adapted to a solitary
            arboreal existence. The earliest Terran explorers saw in them a
            vague resemblance to the Terran lion, and they have been described
            (by Terrans) as lion-like ever since, although there is very little
            true similarity. There are two sexes, male and female. Females
            outnumber males by 3:1.

            Interstellar, multi-sector government of the many Aslan clans. Aslan
            society centers on the clan. Within the Hierate, the family
            structure of the Aslan and the governmental structure are the same.
            The highest governmental functions are performed by a council of
            twenty-nine clan leaders chosen from amongst the most powerful
            clans. "The 29" (as they are called) have quasi-religious status and
            represent the essential unity of the Aslan race. To be chosen one of
            "The 29" is the highest honor to which any Aslan can aspire. The 29
            meet continously on Kuzu to adjudicate inter-clan disputes and
            decide matters of group policy. No member of the 29 speaks for the
            Hierate as a whole, nor does the whole 29.<br></br>
            <br></br>There are no Hierate military forces; each clan its own,
            and they rarely act in concert with those of other clans. The
            Hierate itself can call upon military forces only insofar as the
            clans themselves agree to provide such forces. Even the minor forces
            conveying the 29's decisions are actually under the control of
            individual clan leaders. See also Aslan, Aslan Border Wars, Kuzu.

            The science of mapping interstellar space. Basic to any science of
            mapping is a coordinate system. The system used by the Imperium is
            based on rings of longitude, rays of latitude, and parsecs. Rays of
            latitude extend from the galactic core, while concentric rings of
            longitude are placed at one parsec intervals. By convention, the
            concentric ring passing through Reference/Capital is labelled the
            10,000th ring, and is used as a baseline. Similarly, the ray of
            latitude extending from the center of the Galaxy through
            Reference/Capital is designated as the first ray. Measurement is in
            parsecs, counting in the trailing direction. Computation reveals
            that the circumference of the 10,000th ring (r=10,000) is 62,832
            parsecs. Counting spinward uses a subtraction from 62,833, which is
            the equivalent of the zero baseline.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            For example, Regina, of the Regina Subsector, in the Spinward
            Marches, is 9930 ring/ray 62723. The format for expression of
            location is xxxx ring/ray yyyyy, where xxxx is the ring of longitude
            (distance from the galactic core in parsecs), and VVyyy is the
            distance of the ray of latitude (in parsecs) from the first ray of
            lati- tude, measured along the ring of longitude in the trailing
            direction.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            This mapping system is highly Imperio-centric, and other systems are
            used by other peoples and races outside the Imperium. This system
            has gained wide acceptance, however, among Imperium dominated
            client-states, human and otherwise. This mapping system breaks down
            and is prone to error beyond certain limits. It does serve admirably
            for a band approximately 400 parsecs wide at a longitude of 10,000
            parsecs.

            (-4045 to -2219). The first major interstellar civilization,
            politically and culturally dominated by humans originating on Vland.
            The jump drive was discovered on Vland in -9235. Immediately the
            Vilani discovered a number of interfertile and technologically
            primitive human races on worlds within 60 parsecs. These were
            gradually brought to a high-technology state with Vilani help, and
            assimilated into a loose interstellar community bound by trade and
            common culture. Eventually, the client races themselves explored
            beyond the local sphere, contacting and trading with still more
            races. These new races gained their technology without being
            assimilated into Vilani culture; the resulting increasing friction
            eventually resulted in a series of wars, beginning about -5400. In
            response to the threat, Viand began tightening its control of it's
            trade sphere, finally organizing it into a centralized state in
            -5273. This marked the beginning of the First Imperium, although
            there was as yet no emperor.<br></br>
            <br></br>During the thousand year period of the Consolidation Wars,
            Viand conquered and absorbed its enemies until in there were no
            longer any civilized states on its borders (except for a portion of
            the Vargr Extents, isolated from the Imperium by the Great Rift).
            The last war ended in -4045, and Vilani dating begins at this point.
            With no exterior threats, the Pax Vilanica lasted for nearly 1200
            years; at its height, attained soon after the end of the wars, the
            First Imperium contained 27 sectors and over 15,000 worlds. However,
            the cost of maintaining centralized control over this vast expanse
            was cultural rigidity; exploration had ceased with the beginning of
            the wars; now scientific research slowed to a halt, and the
            beginnings of a hereditary caste system began to emerge.
            Civilization was in decline. As long as there was no exterior
            threat, the Imperium was safe; but gradually, despite all efforts,
            technology leaked across the borders. New interstellar states arose,
            and the Imperium could no longer afford to absorb them. Gradually,
            the Imperium lost territory along its coreward and trailing marches.
            Then, in -2422, the Imperium was contacted along its rimward border
            by the Terrans, recently emerged into space. Terran expansionism led
            to a series of interstellar wars, ultimately resulting in Terran
            conquest of the Imperium in -2219 and the founding of the Rule of
            Man.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>The First Imperium bore many names in its long life,
            including the Grand Imperium of Stars, the Grand Imperium, and the
            Vilani Empire.

            North and South do not work when referring to directions within the
            galaxy. Instead, the following conventions have achieved widespread
            acceptance when referring to direction.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Toward the galactic core is <b>coreward</b>, away from it, in the
            direction of the rim is <b>rimward</b>. In the direction in which
            the galaxy is rotating is <b>spinward</b>, while the other direction
            is <b>trailing</b>.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            These directions are in widespread use in describing Imperial
            features and businesses. For example, the Spinward Marches is a
            sector at the extreme spinward fringe of the Imperium; Rimward Lines
            is an important interstellar transport company.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Finally, within the Imperium, the term coreward is also used to
            indicate the direction of Capital, the Imperial core. There is some
            potential for confusion if the term is accepted out of context.

            Intelligent major race with a large federation trailing the
            Imperium. Hivers average 1.5 meters from ground to top of upraised
            head and weigh about 150 kilos. Descended from omnivore
            gatherer/scavenger stock, they are the most alien of the major
            races. Hivers exhibit a modified six-fold radial symmetry; the body
            has a calcareous internal skeleton consisting of a series of rings
            supporting the limbs and a fused carapace protecting the brain and
            internal organs.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The head is a modification of one of the limbs and contains six
            eyestalks and six manipulative tentacles, plus paired infrared
            sensor organs. The other five limbs are identical (except for slight
            modifications of the hand opposite the head) and are used as arms
            and legs indiscriminately. Each limb ends in a six-fingered radial
            hand. Fingers are very flexible and have muscular suction cups on
            the lower surface about halfway to the tips. Hiver arms and hands
            are generally weaker than human, but are very tough and difficult to
            injure.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The mouth (digestive opening) is on the lower surface of the body.
            There is no sound-producting organ, but hivers do have three ears
            placed around the neck near the head.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Hivers have only one sex. Reproductive cells are exhanged each time
            that hivers meet, using the modified rear hand (the process has been
            termed by humans "shaking hands"). The cells are kept in a
            reproductive pouch on the lower body surface where they conjugate,
            exchanging genetic material. Once every forty days or so, a cell
            will develop into a larva, which then drops from the parent's body.
            Hive planets are mostly wilderness, and the larva will enter the
            wilds, where most are killed. After about a year, survivors return
            to civilization, where they are welcomed into any nest and begin
            their education as citizens. Parental instinct in hivers is very
            strong, and the young are adopted by the entire nest. (Note that
            this instinct applies only to the year-old returnees; Hivers have no
            concern for the younger larvae, and in fact consider them minor
            pests.)<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Hiver language is a combination of arm/tentacle waving and physical
            contact. The written language is ideographic, and is used as a
            standard language among the races of the Hive Federation. Hivers
            talking among themselves use all three aspects of language (gesture,
            touch, and writing) at once, a process capable of great subtlety and
            sophistication, but unintelligible to the outsider.

            Worlds orbiting different stars are reached by interstellar travel,

            distance from a world, it may activate its jump drive. Jump drives
            are rated from 1 to 6: the number of parsecs which can be travelled
            in one week. Actually, making any jump takes about one week,
            regardless of the distance travelled. Transit time to 100 diameters
            from a size 8 world takes 5 hours at 1G acceleration.

            The Centaurs (they call themselves K'kree) are among the most
            massive of the major races, and are the only examples of the major
            races to be descended from herbivores. An adult Centaur stands about
            1.5 meters at the shoulder and between 2.0 and 2.4 meters tall when
            standing erect. Weight averages 550 kilograms. They are bilaterally
            symmetrical, hexapedal, and homeothermic. They bear some resemblance
            to the centaurs of ancient Terran myth, a trait noted by the
            earliest explorers.<br></br>
            <br></br>Centaurs are extremely conservative in all aspects of their
            culture. Ceremonial military units (such as bodyguards) are armed
            with equipment which K'kree military technology outdated centuries
            ago, and (aside from modifications made necessary by the discovery
            of spaceflight) K'kree government has not changed significantly in
            centuries.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Because of their origins as plains dwelling herd animals, the
            Centaurs are claustrophobes; they cannot stand to be enclosed.
            Centaur cities are clumps of low, broad, transparent domes, the
            buildings inside never more than one story in height and open to the
            sky. Internal building divisions are achieved with curtains or
            tapestries.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Centaurs are extremely gregarious. They are never found alone, and
            will quickly sicken and die if removed from other K'kree for any
            length of time. Receiving a trade or diplomatic delegation from the
            centaurs means entertaining the entire family (one or more wives,
            servants, scribes, assistants, etc) of the merchant or the
            ambassador.

            Millions of organizations do business within and without the
            Imperium. Most of these are limited to one or two worlds. A few
            thousand trade over one or more subsectors, a few hundred cover one
            or more sectors. Only a few firms are truly Imperial in scope; these
            are known as megacorporations. Staggering in size, these
            organizations are so large that no one person can know everything
            they are concerned with at any given moment. Total shares of stock,
            annual profits, and number of employees are all astronomical. Many
            organizations are so large that different divisions of the same
            megacorporation may actually be working at cross purposes. In most
            regions, megacorporations merely own the land their installations
            are on, but in some areas they control entire planets, either
            directly or indirectly.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Most megacorporations are organized very much like smaller companies
            (with a board of directors, a president, and vice presidents), but
            the board and the higher level executive officers of the company are
            largely out of contact with the day to day (or even year to year)
            functioning of the company. These upper level executives serve to
            plan general policy and long distance actions. The most important
            executives, in terms of personal power, are the various regional
            managers (by whatever name they may be called). A regional manager
            may control only a small portion of a megacorporation's total
            assets, but many hold more power in some regions than the
            representatives of the Imperial government.<br></br>
            <br></br>A small number of Imperial regulatory agencies have power
            over megacorporations, and they are subject to any applicable local
            taxes, but, provided they do not blatantly violate Imperial
            sovereignty, regional managers can usually conduct their company's
            business as they see fit. Because a direct confrontation with the
            Imperium would be bad for business, intentional violation of
            Imperial laws is done only on a covert basis.

          <ModalBody>
            Port facility for the support, maintenance, repair, and refit of
            naval vessels. Planetary surface facilities are generally provided
            for vessels of 1,000 tons or less; orbital facilities handle larger
            ships.<br></br>
            <br></br>A naval base has several distinct parts to it; each part
            helps in the accomplishment of the overall mission of the base. The
            typical naval base is composed of an orbital berthing area, a
            surface berthing area, a maintenance section, and an administrative
            headquarters.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Berthing areas provide locations for ships to lay over, whether for
            a day or for months. All berthing areas include provisions for
            refueling from storage tanks or fuel lighters. Maintenance sections
            at naval bases vary from base to base. Where such a section would be
            redundant to the local starport shipyard, it is small, and repairs
            or alterations are carried out under contract to the local facility.
            Where adequate facilities do not exist, the naval base itself may
            have a large maintenance section capable of extensive repairs and
            refits. Maintenance is performed on the ships on the world surface
            or in orbit as necessary.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The administrative headquarters handles the day-to-day operations of
            the base, as well as its paperwork (including the allocation of
            funds, distribution of personnel, and disbursement of maintenance
            and repair contracts).<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The naval base is not a tactical unit. It has no battle forces of
            its own, and does not exert control even over local system defense
            boats (which are under a separate command). The naval base is
            responsible for supporting the fleet and keeping it in optimum
            condition for its combat missions.

            The use of mental powers to manipulate matter and energy, to sense,
            and to communicate. It has been demonstrated that minds (human or
            non-human, conscious or unconscious, intelligent or unintelligent)
            contain some capacity to operate without apparent use of physical
            facilities. Until circa - 1000, psionics was little studied in most
            regions, except on a disorganized level (parapsychology, the occult,
            spiritualism, and so on). It was known and practiced among the
            Zhodani, and by some minor races, but it was by no means widespread.
            However, during the Long Night, many races, (human and others)
            turned introspective. As a result, many finally began to engage in
            serious research in psionics, which revealed much about the
            empirical nature of the phenomenon, although the principles involved
            were, and remain, little understood.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            However, even though it assumed scientific validity, psionics
            remained a backwater science until about 650, when it underwent a
            tremendous burst of popularity. Psionics within the Imperium reached
            its peak in the latter half of the 700's. In the 790's, however, the
            crest of popular opinion broke with the revelation of scandals
            within the Psionics Institutes; the result was the psionics
            suppressions (800 to 826), which shifted public opinion away from
            support of psionics.

            The Traveller's Aid Society travel zone classification for a nation,
            world, or system which is dangerous to travellers. In general, the
            imposition of a red zone classification indicates the location is
            quarantined, interdicted by higher authority, or at war.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Quarantine indicates that a dangerous disease is present, and the
            danger of war is self-explanatory, but interdiction requires further
            discussion. Interstellar governments often find it necessary to
            restrict access to worlds or systems for political or military
            reasons, and do so by publishing interdictions. Enforcement of
            interdiction varies with the reason for the restriction.
            Interdiction may be imposed on a world if it is a military base or
            other sensitive installation, for the private reservations belonging
            to powerful families desiring seclusion, for developing societies
            which the government has elected to allow to evolve in isolation, or
            for valuable resource areas being saved for later development or
            exploitation.

            (-2204 to -1776): A short-lived interstellar empire, formed after
            the conquest of the Vilani Imperium by the Terrans.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The conquered territories were under military rule from -2219 to
            -2204. Vilani military forces were incorporated into the Terran
            forces. Terran naval officers took over key posts in the Vilani
            bureaucracy (which was otherwise retained intact).<br></br>
            <br></br>
            In -2204, the Terran Secretariat attempted to transfer control
            directly to Terra, and incorporate the conquered regions into the
            Terran Confederation. The commander in chief of the Terran navy,
            Admiral Hiroshi Estigarribia, realized that the Confederation
            government could not possibly control the vast territories of the
            Vilani Imperium and proclaimed himself Regent of the Vilani Imperium
            and Protector of Terra, with both states now united in the Rule of
            Man. Nearly all the fleet sided with Estigarribia, both because it
            was composed largely of colonials, who were under-represented under
            the Terran Confederation government (q.v.), and because of
            Estigarribia's careful preparation. The Confederation was dissolved
            without significant resistance.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The Terran fleet headquarters on Dingir became the capital of the
            Rule of Man. The bureaucratic center of the Imperium remained on
            Vland, although arrangements were undertaken to gradually transfer
            it elsewhere.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Upon Estigarribia's death, he was succeeded by his chief of staff,
            who crowned himself Emperor Hiroshi II. Estigarribia, even though he
            did not actually assume the crown, is therefore known to history as
            Emperor Hiroshi I.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Hiroshi II transferred all functions of government from both Viand
            and Dingir to a more centrally located world, renamed bilingually
            Hub/Ershur. This world was to remain the capital of the Rule of Man
            for the next four hundred years.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            During the Rule of Man, large numbers of humans from Terra and its
            oldest colonies emigrated throughout the Imperium. People of Terran
            ancestry or culture (many of them assimilated Vilani) assumed
            positions of power on most worlds, becoming industrialists and
            administrators.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The problems of sheer size and scientific stagnation, which had
            brought about the fall of the Vilani Imperium, continued to plague
            the Rule of Man. The Vilani had coped with the problems of ruling a
            large empire by a rigid caste system with all citizens rooted
            permanently in their places, but this system could last only as long
            as there was no significant external threat. The Terrans did away
            with this system, but were not able to replace it with a new social
            order. The destruction of the caste system swept away the
            foundations of society. Key industries fell apart as their workers
            became free to move elsewhere.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The -1776 date for the end of the Rule of Man is arbitrary, and
            notes the financial collapse of the central government, when the
            Treasury at Hub/Ershur refused to honor a monetary issue of the
            branch treasury at Antares. The resulting lack of confidence within
            monetary circles marked the end of large-scale interstellar trade
            and of effective governmental power within the Rule of Man. Although
            the Imperium did not completely fall apart for many years, the Rule
            of Man had effectively ceased to exist as a viable interstellar
            community, and the period known as Twilight (q.v.) had begun.

            scattered throughout the Im- perium, with installations tending to

            bases tend to be surface installations equipped with basic
            facilities for fueling and for minor maintenance activities oriented
            toward ships of 1,000 tons or less.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Scout bases are positioned in systems more out of the way than are
            naval bases, and for a reason. The scout bases serve as a source of
            ships carrying dispatches from the well-travelled xboat lanes to
            more remote worlds. Scout bases also have other responsibilities,
            and most have an administrative responsibility in addition to the
            maintenance and refueling of scout ships. Within a subsector, one
            base will hold responsibility for cartography within the subsector,
            another will be responsible for technical developments, and still
            another for contact or liaison activities. The scout base is more
            extensive than an xboat station, but less comprehensive than a way
            station.{" "}

            the original human stock (H. sapiens). The term Solomani is often
            used to refer to members of the Solomani race (or, more palatably to
            some, to members of the human race of Solomani descent) or to
            members of the Solomani political movement. Its original meaning is
            obscure, but the word seems to have originally meant either men of
            Sol or sole men.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            After the Solomani developed jump drives in -2431, Solomani humans
            were scattered to the stars in several waves. Early colonization
            efforts first settled the worlds closest to Terra; the later
            conquest of the First Imperium and the establishment of the Rule of
            Man sent more Solomani humans out, primarily to occupy the former
            Imperial regions.

            In 871, the government of the Solomani Autonomous Region reorganized
            itself as the Solomani Confederation, in an attempt to strengthen
            its claims to the heritage of the old Terran Confederation (q.v.).
            Although tantamount to a declaration of independence, the
            reorganization was officially ignored by the government of the
            Imperium, until the increasingly belligerent and extremist policies
            of the Solomani caused many border worlds under Solomani rule to
            petition the Imperium for redress.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The branches of the Solomani Confederation's government took the
            names of the government of the Terran Confederation, but the present
            institutions have little resemblance to those of the past. The chief
            governing body of the Solomani Confederation is the Secretariat. The
            Secretariat is presided over by the Secretary General, who is
            elected from its membership. The Secretary General is the chief
            administrative officer of the Solomani government, and while the
            office holds great power, it is fully accountable to the
            Secretariat.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Representatives to the Secretariat are appointed by the governments
            of the individual districts. The number of representatives each
            district may appoint is determined according to that district's
            contribution to the Solomani economy. A district typically consists
            of a single world, but low population worlds or depressed areas are
            combined into multi-world districts. In the case of a district such
            as this, an election is held to determine the representative from
            that district. These, however, are not elections in the normal
            sense; the governments vote, rather than the populace. Each
            government of such a district is allocated votes (again, according
            to its economic importance) which are used to elect a representative
            for that district.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            All government officeholders and officials must be members of the
            official party, the Solomani Movement. Although formerly of great
            power and influence, the party is now weak, decentralized, and of
            little importance. Real power in the Confederation is held by the
            government and the factions.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Because of the greater degree of local autonomy that exists in the
            Solomani Confederation, interworld factionalism exists to a much
            greater degree than would be allowed in the Imperium. Coalitions of
            worlds exist outside the normal government channels, sometimes
            equalling them in importance within a given region. For example, the
            Near Bootes cluster, in the Capella subsector, dominates large
            portions of the adjacent subsectors, both economically and
            politically. Bootean mercantile interests heavily favor peaceful
            trade with the Imperium, and their influence with the Confederation
            government is considered to be the primary reason for the unofficial
            detente between the Confederation and the Imperium. Another example
            of this factionalism is the ongoing trade war between Kukulcan
            (Kukulcan 0405) and the coalition of Thetis (Kukulcan 0108) and
            Laputa (Kukulcan 0310). The war is causing severe damage to the
            economy of Kukulcan, but the Thetis-Laputa coalition has thus far
            been able to muster enough power to prevent effective intervention
            by the Confederation government.

            Establishment for the landing, servicing, refueling, and control of

            ground).<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Starports generally have two components: a surface facility and an
            orbital facility. The surface facility includes cargo handling
            installations, a landing field, control towers, and other necessary
            areas. Surface starport components are frequently called Down (as in
            Regina Down Starport). Orbital facilities are present (usually in
            stationary orbit above the surface component) to enable handling of
            unstreamlined ships, and to allow construction of heavy craft in
            orbit. The orbital component is often called Orbital (as in Regina
            Orbital Starport). Type D and E starports have no extensive orbital
            facilities, but usually have navigational satellites or similar
            equipment. Non-streamlined ships at these starports must be serviced
            by shuttles. Starports, being the primary point at which starships
            interact with a system, are usually the location for additional
            bases, such as scout bases, naval bases or other military
            installations, and for shipyards.

            <ModalTitle>The Two Thousand Worlds</ModalTitle>
          </ModalHeader>
          <ModalBody>
            Most common name in the Imperium for the region of space ruled by
            the K'kree. Two thousand worlds is a literal translation of the
            K'kree <em>T't'tkahk Xeng Kirr</em>. The same words can also be
            rendered idiomatically as "universe". In times past, the words meant
            "night sky", as roughly two thousand stars can be seen from one
            hemisphere of Kirur, the K'kree homeworld. The name should not be
            taken to mean that there are exactly 2000 worlds in the K'kree
            empire.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The K'kree government is highly conservative. The current dynasty
            ruling the Two Thousand Worlds has been in power since prehistoric
            times, and the form of the government has remained unchanged except
            for a few minor modifications made necessary by the problems
            inherent in governing an interstellar empire.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            K'kree expansion into space progressed very slowly after the
            discovery of the jump drive in -4142. The conservative nature of
            society and the technical limitations placed upon spaceflight by
            that society (K'Kree spaceships must be very large, for example)
            combined to inhibit early exploration and colonization.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The discovery of other sophonts caused a xenophobic reaction in
            K'kree society. The realization that intelligent carnivores might
            exist somewhere in space sparked the K'kree obsession to convert the
            universe to herbivorism. This obsession stimulated the growth of the
            Two Thousand Worlds to its present size and still dominates K'kree
            culture. Local cultures are tolerated and other aspects of K'kree
            society are not heavily enforced, but all races within the Two
            Thousand Worlds are herbivorous.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            K'kree contact with the Hive Federation was soon followed by the
            Hiver-K'kree war of -2029 to -2013. The military technology of the
            K'kree proved superior in the first stages of the war. The war ended
            due to non-military considerations, however, when the Hive
            Federation demonstrated a plan to radically alter the K'kree social
            order through the use of psychohistorical techniques, and threatened
            to implement it. The K'kree withdrew to the antebellum borders, and
            the border between the two states has remained stable to this day.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The K'Kree empire eventually stopped in its expansion. Increasing
            problems of administration over interstellar distances and contact
            with other starfaring races (such as Hivers and humaniti) have
            stabilized the Two Thousand Worlds at its present size.

            <ModalTitle>Vargr</ModalTitle>
          </ModalHeader>
          <ModalBody>
            Intelligent major race derived from Ancient genetic manipulations of
            Terran carnivore/chaser stock, apparently dating from approximately
            the same time that humaniti was scattered to the stars. Inhabiting a
            region rimward of the Imperium, the Vargr were for years a puzzle to
            Imperial xenologists. The Vargr biochemistry and genetic makeup are
            almost identical with a number of terrestrial animals, but differ
            radically from most of the flora and fauna indigenous to Lair, the
            purported Vargr home world. Researches during the early years of the
            Third Im- perium concluded them to be the result of genetic
            manipulation of transplanted Terran animals of the family Canidae,
            almost certainly of genus Canis. The obvious conclusion, supported
            by archeological evidence, is that the race known as the Ancients
            was responsible.<br></br>
            <br></br>Physically, the Vargr are not very impressive. The typical
            Vargr is about 1.6 meters in height and weighs approximately 60
            kilograms. They are upright bipedal carnivores, rear limbs
            digitigrade, with hands very similar in size and appearance to those
            of a human, although there are significant internal differences.
            They have approximately the same physical parameters as humans and
            are able to use the same equipment without modification or
            additional instruction.<br></br>
            <br></br>On the average their reactions are slightly faster than
            those of the typical human, but individuals vary widely. The Vargr
            senses of smell and sight are superior to those of humans.<br></br>
            <br></br>There is no central Vargr government; indeed, there is no
            governmental type that can be said to be "typically Vargr". Every
            conceivable form of governmental organization can be found somewhere
            in the Vargr Extents. The only cohesive force in the Extents is a
            fierce racial pride which causes a slight tendency towards racial
            cooperation.<br></br>
            <br></br>The higher the level of the Vargr government, the more
            unstable it becomes because of the difficulty of obtaining consent
            of all Vargr involved.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            While only a few planets populated completely by Vargr exist within
            the Imperium, there are millions of Vargr citizens of loyal subject
            planets. Additionally, Vargr adventurers, criminals, mercenaries and
            traders can be found throughout the coreward reaches of the
            Imperium.<br></br>
            <br></br>The key elements shaping Vargr societies are a very strong
            centrifugal force resulting from an emphasis on consensus and
            informal lines of authority, and an equally strong centripetal force
            resulting from a deeply ingrained family-clan- tribe-nation loyalty.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>Centralized authority is extremely limited at the upper
            levels of Vargr society, and action is based on broad coalitional
            concerns, with a constant splitting and rejoining of dissident
            factions. Traditionally, this has made it very difficult for more
            centralized and organized societies such as the Imperium to deal on
            a meaningful basis with what passes for Vargr states.<br></br>
            <br></br>The Vargr have little respect for formal authority,
            decreasing as that authority becomes more remote. Vargr generally
            have more respect for more informal authority figures, and are more
            likely to obey superiors who are better known to them.<br></br>
            <br></br>The Vargr have an intensive racial pride and are easily
            insulted. They are prone to enter into fights without regard to
            possible consequences. Vargr social organization is difficult to
            characterize in Terran terms, but can be most closely compared to
            the Dakota Sioux of North America in the 1800's AD, if the analogy
            is not pressed too far. Even among the most stable Vargr
            governments, a highly charismatic leader can attract followers for
            almost anything. The neighbors of the Vargr are constantly the
            subject of impromptu raids and scattered piracy by bands of Vargr
            (totally without government sanction, of course) who have been
            talked into a raid, a battle, or a war by a charismatic leader.

            The Vilani were the first of humaniti to develop the jump drive (in

            empire.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The old Vilani culture which developed during the first Imperium was
            a rigid caste system based on the idea that each citizen had a
            specific and set place in the universe, and it was each citizen's
            duty to remain in that place. Society could not afford to let
            individuals do as they pleased. Not all of the subject races of the
            Vilani Imperium were able to be completely absorbed into this
            culture (the Vegans, for example) and those societies did not do
            well under the Vilani Imperium.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            The stability which Vilani culture achieved was not obtained without
            cost. Cultural rigidity brought with it stagnation, and the Vilani
            Imperium collapsed soon after contact with the young, vigorous
            Terran Confederation.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Currently, Vilani is a cultural rather than a racial or national
            labelling, and is applied to those within the Imperium who retain
            some of the old ways. The Vilani language survives in certain
            places, along with a few fragments of Vilani culture, such as
            musical forms and other fine arts. Certain of the old Vilani noble
            families have maintained more of the old culture, particularly the
            families who control the Vilani megacorporations.

            The primary means of interstellar communication is the physical
            transport of messages by a jump-capable ship. Within the Imperium,
            the method is called the express boat, or X-Boat, system. Small,

            large jumps and carry data for retransmission. Outlying worlds of
            the Imperium stand nearly four years from the capital, and express
            boat links have been established to insure the rapid transmission of
            messages (governmental, commercial, and private) with a maximum of
            efficiency.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Selected locations along major trade routes are established as
            express stations; as orbital facilities which service and refuel
            xboats on their communications runs. As an xboat arrives in a
            system, it beams its recorded messages to the express station, which
            then retransmits them to an xboat standing by for a jump outsystem.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>Time between jumps is almost always less than four hours,
            and can be under seven minutes. The speed of communication is thus
            nearly the speed of jump (xboats are equipped with jump-4 drives,
            four parsecs per week). In practice, this speed is somewhat reduced
            as trade routes do not follow straight lines, and not all jumps are
            made at jump-4. Average speed approximates jump-2.6 per week.

            Human major race (H. sapiens) inhabiting the Zhodani Consulate, a
            region far spinward of the Imperium.<br></br>
            <br></br>The Zhodani are a branch of humaniti similar in most
            respects to other human races. In general, they tend to be taller
            than Solomani or Vilani, and lithe of build. Their most important
            difference is the acceptance and use of psionics. Zhodani society is
            divided into three classes: nobles, intendants, and proles. Nobles
            are the enfranchised ruling class, and receive psionic training from
            childhood. Intendants are managers and administrators of society,
            and also receive early training. Proles constitute the masses, are
            forbidden the use of psionics, and do not receive training. Within
            this rigid class system, there are two opportunities for promotion
            to a higher class. All prole children are tested for psionic
            potential, and those showing high scores are taken from their
            families and adopted into the intendant class. Intendants are
            rewarded for great diligence, service to the state, or victory in
            the psionic games through the granting of noble titles.<br></br>
            <br></br>The presence of psionics in the hands of those in power
            means that many aspects of society work at high efficiency.
            Psychology, behavioral science, communications science, and
            education are more refined and exact than in other societies.
            Educational methods are finely tuned, and capable of teaching
            concepts rapidly and accurately. Mental deviance or criminal
            tendencies can be detected early and corrected with facility.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>Zhodani society is generally a happy one. Individuals are
            members of a functioning whole, with each making a contribution to
            its success. The relative lack of upward mobility for the proles is
            offset by the possibility for their children to move upwards if they
            have the proper potential. The burden of responsibility imposed on
            the intendants is lightened by the ever-present possibility of
            reward through elevation to the noble classes. The nobles themselves
            temper their burden of authority with comfort derived from their
            station in life.<br></br>
            <br></br>The Zhodani have a general distaste for other human races
            which do not practice psionics. Effective indoctrination and
            ever-present possibility that one's mind is being read have removed
            dishonesty and deviance as common features of society. Disagreements
            still occur, competition thrives, passions flare. But all takes
            place in an atmosphere of honesty and truth. Individuals can express
            their feelings without fear and problems are openly dealt with. In
            non-psionic societies, much is kept secret within the mind. A
            Zhodani visiting the Imperium would be appalled by the deviousness
            and dishonesty that pervades society.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Imperial distaste for the Zhodani is based on two facts. First, the
            Zhodani practice psionics, and an Imperial cannot be sure that a
            Zhodani is not invading his mental privacy at any time. Imperials
            feel exposed and uncomfortable in the presence of Zhodani. Second,
            because of their psionic abilities, the Zhodani have the most
            effective authoritarian rule in history. Imperial citizens, used to
            a great degree of local autonomy, fear Zhodani conquest because of
            the loss of freedom it would entail.<br></br>
            <br></br>The Zhodani date their empire from the traditional date of
            the first organized use of psionics on Zhodane, -6731 Imperial, the
            year of the first olympiad. They achieved jump drive about 1300
            years later, in -5415 Imperial. The expansion of the Zhodani was
            gradual and uneventful. Although some states on the fringe resisted
            absorption into the Consulate, most were annexed peacefully. The
            Zhodani first came into conflict with the expanding Third Imperium
            in the 500's, starting the First Frontier War in a dispute over
            present and future limits to settlement in the Spinward Marches
            area. Continuing frontier wars over the next five hundred years have
            failed to resolve the basic differences between the two empires.
